### <u>Purpose / Audience</u>

This portfolio webiste was created to showcase my skills as a developer and personal interests with the intent of connecting and collaborating with other like-minded developers and potential employers. 

### <u>Features</u>

##### <u>Clean Crisp Design</u>

Minimalist design of small chunks of text with big, bold headings in an asymmetrical pattern with contemporary, trendy colour combinations add to a capitivating UI.

##### <u>Responsive Build</u>

Designed for the mobile up with a responsive build. Hamburger menu switches out for top navbar in desktop version. The site is not designed for specific device breakpoints as there is such a huge variety but rather to keep the design flow as it changes size.

With a perfect desktop accessbility score of 100 and 93 for mobile, (using Chrome's audit tools) the site has a high level of accessiblity.
